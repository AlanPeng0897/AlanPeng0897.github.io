I'm a PhD student at Hong Kong Baptist University, advised by [Prof. Bo Han](https://bhanml.github.io/). I am also very fortunate to work closely with [Prof. Mingyuan Zhou](https://mingyuanzhou.github.io/) and [Prof. Feng Liu](https://fengliu90.github.io/index.html).

My current research focuses on AI safety, with a particular emphasis on developing principled and insightful machine learning algorithms to better understand and improve privacy and security in modern AI systems.

Outside of work, I enjoy running, basketball, and hiking. I'm highly curiosity-driven and read widely in my free time.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
